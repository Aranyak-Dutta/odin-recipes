    <p>A BBQ Ranch Chicken Wrap is the ultimate fusion of smoky, tangy, and creamy 
        flavors, all tucked into a soft, portable package. It’s a crowd-favorite lunch or dinner option that balances the heat of 
        the grill with the coolness of the garden.</p>

        all tied together by the iconic pairing of BBQ and Ranch."</p>

        <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>

    <h3>Steps
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for
             medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with seasoned salt and pepper. Grill chicken over direct heat until juices run clear, turning once or twice, 8 to 10 minutes. Move to an unheated part of the grill and lather with BBQ sauce; let stand until sauce becomes sticky, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and cut into bite-sized cubes.</li>
        <li>Divide chicken, bacon, tomato, lettuce, Colby cheese, and ranch among tortillas. Roll up tortillas and grill over direct heat, folded-side down, until cheese melts, about 1 minute per side. Cut wraps in half to serve.</li>
